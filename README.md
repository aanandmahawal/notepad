This is a simple web-based Note Diary application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add, edit, and delete notes to keep track of their thoughts, tasks, or diary entries.

## Features

- **Add Notes**: Users can create new notes with a title and content.
- **Edit Notes**: Users can edit the content of existing notes.
- **Delete Notes**: Users can delete notes that are no longer needed.
- **Persistent Notes**: Notes are stored in the browser's local storage so that they persist even after the page is reloaded.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the note diary page.
- **CSS**: Styling to make the application user-friendly and visually appealing.

2. The note is saved in the browser's local storage so it persists after a page refresh.
3. The user can edit or delete any existing note.
4. The list of notes will always be displayed in the browser, and updates to notes are automatically reflected.
